<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Our Vision is *to Rapidly Accelerate the Creation and Adoption of world-class Education Technology for School Automation.*

There are many great School Management Software available in the market today; however, we can't find one that really automate activities in schools so we created this innovative solution. We want to create a software so amazing that it'll be the last one schools ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Schools should be focused on creating something amazing,  that solves a problem and helps others; and not the boring routine tasks
* Schools shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like grading of assessments
* Schools should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one software will serve all schools since their needs may be different. So we'll be building a scalable, robust and flexible system that can be adjusted as we progress. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this product!
